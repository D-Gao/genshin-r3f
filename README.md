# Genshin Impact Login Page Replica Using R3F

This project is inspired by the 2 open source projects available on GitHub.

- [gamemcu / www-genshin](https://github.com/gamemcu/www-genshin)
- [alphardex / genshin-replica](https://github.com/alphardex/genshin-replica)

For pure learning purpose I have completly rewritten the project using React Three Fiber.

# More info

Actually I have already implemented the project in [D-Gao / React-3d-Fiber-Learning](https://github.com/D-Gao/React-3d-Fiber-Learning) repository under the /genshin path. However, for hosting purposes, I've decided to migrate the project into this monorepo. This will also allow for potential optimizations as I plan to rewrite the project from scratch.

# Run the project

- install all dependecies

```sh
npm install
```

- local development

```sh
npm run dev
```

- production build

```sh
npm run build
```
